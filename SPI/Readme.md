### SPI
- SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a synchronous serial communication protocol commonly used in embedded systems for short-distance communication between microcontrollers and peripheral devices.
- **Synchronous**: Data transfer is synchronized by a clock signal generated by the master device.   
- **Full-duplex**: Allows simultaneous data transmission and reception.   
- **Master-Slave Architecture**: Typically involves one master device and one or more slave devices. The master controls the communication process, including clock generation and data transfer.   
- **Simple Wiring**: Requires four main signals:
  1. SCLK (Serial Clock): Generated by the master to synchronize data transfer.
  2. MOSI (Master Out Slave In): Data line for the master to transmit data to the slave.
  3. MISO (Master In Slave Out): Data line for the slave to transmit data to the master.
  4. SS (Slave Select): Active-low signal used to select a specific slave device for communication.   

#### Communication Process
1. Master Initialization: The master asserts the SS signal (sets it low) to select a specific slave device.
2. Data Transmission:
  - The master generates the SCLK signal.
  - On each rising edge of the SCLK, the master transmits a data bit on the MOSI line.
  - Simultaneously, the slave receives the data bit on the MOSI line and transmits its own data bit on the MISO line.
3. Data Reception: The master receives the data from the slave on the MISO line on each falling edge of the SCLK.
4. Communication End: The master de-asserts the SS signal to deselect the slave device.
