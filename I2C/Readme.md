### I2C
- I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a serial communication protocol widely used in embedded systems for short-distance communication between devices.   
- Synchronous: Data transfer is synchronized by a clock signal (SCL - Serial Clock) generated by the master device.   
- Multi-master/Multi-slave: Allows multiple master devices on the same bus, although typically only one master is active at a time. Supports multiple slave devices connected to the bus.   
-  Simple Wiring: Requires only two wires:
- SCL (Serial Clock): Generated by the master to synchronize data transfer.   
- SDA (Serial Data): Bidirectional line for data transmission.   
  
Low-speed: Compared to other protocols like SPI, I2C is generally slower.   

#### Communication Process
- Start Condition: The master initiates communication by pulling the SDA line low while SCL is high.
- Slave Address: The master transmits a 7-bit slave address followed by a read/write bit (R/W).
  1. If R/W is '0', the master is requesting data from the slave (read operation).
  2. If R/W is '1', the master is sending data to the slave (write operation).     
- Slave Acknowledgment: The selected slave responds with an acknowledgment bit (ACK) on the SDA line.   
- Data Transfer:
  1. Write Operation: The master transmits data bytes, and the slave acknowledges each byte with an ACK.
  2. Read Operation: The slave transmits data bytes, and the master acknowledges each byte with an ACK.
- Stop Condition: The master ends communication by releasing the SDA line while SCL is high.
